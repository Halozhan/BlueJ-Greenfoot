documentation URL is accessible or disabled. Then try again.
If this message appears again you should check the log file
with the error messages from Javadoc:

You have indicated you wish to open this
directory as a BlueJ project, however a file

structure. (For example, if the Java class
Shape has a package line of com.aa, then the
file Shape.java must be in a directory aa
which is itself in a directory com. This com
directory in turn must be in another directory
which is the directory you should point BlueJ
to when attempting to open it).

tells Java the package this class is in. Do you
want to move this class to the indicated package
or do you want to leave the class where it is

error-create-vm
BlueJ was unable to create a virtual machine (VM) to execute projects.
This is a serious problem - you will not be able to create objects 
or execute methods without solving it. Often this is caused by overly
restrictive firewall settings.
:
Please see <http://www.bluej.org/help/faq.html#socket-exc> for more
information.

project-is-readonly
The project being opened is read-only:
:
    $
:
To use this project, you will first need to choose a new location to
save it to.

project-is-virtualized
The project you are opening is being virtualized by Windows. This 
usually happens when the project is stored somewhere in the 
"Program Files" directory.
:
When a project is being virtualized by Windows you will get errors 
when trying to create objects and invoke methods.
:
To use this project, you should move the project to a different
location. This can be accomplished by choosing "save as" from 
the Project menu after closing this dialog.

could-not-write-shell-file
Execution failed because the project directory is not writable.
To create objects or execute methods, we must be able to write
to the project directory. Make sure your project is on a writable 
file system (not a CD!) and that you have write permission in
the project directory and all files in it.

jar-output-dir-exists

repository versions. The following files are affected:

team-resolve-conflicts-delete
There are conflicts with some files, which have been modified in the
repository as well as in your working copy. You need to delete your versions
of the following files and then perform an update in order to resolve the
conflict:

team-resolve-merge-conflicts
During a previous update, there were merge conflicts in some files. You need
to edit the following files and resolve the conflicts before you can perform
a commit:

team-unresolved-conflicts
There are unresolved conflicts with the following files. You will
have to delete the files locally to resolve the conflict:

want to use Checkout, to check out the existing project
or rename your project and commit again.

the specified group or project doesn't exist on the server.
Check that these are correct in the Team Settings, and that 
they exist on the server.

team-cant-find-module
Project not in repository. A project must be shared (put

the repository in the team settings.

team-empty-message

committed. You should commit now.

stuck-at-breakpoint
Your program is already running, and stopped at a breakpoint.
You cannot start another execution while the current one is still
active. Use the debugger controls to either continue or terminate
the current execution first.

already-executing
Your program is already running. You cannot start another
execution (or inspect a class) until the execution finishes. If
the program is stuck in a loop, you can use the debugger to
terminate it.

run-on-fx
This project uses JavaFX.  Would you like BlueJ to run all future
method invocations in this project on the JavaFX thread, to avoid
threading exceptions?  You can change this option later in the
Preferences.  If unsure, say "Use JavaFX thread".
